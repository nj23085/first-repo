    /*Polymorphism is a core concept in C++ 
    that allows objects to be treated as 
    instances of their parent class, 
    enabling dynamic binding and method 
    overriding.
    It is of two tyoes:-
    1.Compile time polymorphism:-function call 
    ka decision compile time me le liya jaata hai.
    achieved through:-
    *function overloading
    *operator overloading :- one operator varoius 
    tasks.
    2.Run time polymorphism:-it is complex than
    compile time polymorphism.
    achieved through virtual functions.*/
